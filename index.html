                        <p class="section2__description">Being one of the most common formats for all kinds of scientific and research papers, APA citation format is used mainly in the field of social sciences. It explains how to handle references to both published and unpublished sources, covering various forms of in-text citations and bibliographic lists. <br><br>There are several reasons why you should stick to APA formatting. Firstly, even if you paraphrase someone else's ideas instead of quoting directly, it can be regarded as plagiarism. This may be construed as a breach of ethical norms and lead to serious consequences - at the least, you won't get a good mark for the work you have stolen from someone. Secondly, by having you write term papers and essays, your instructors test your academic writing skills. And why would any teacher give you a good grade if you show your ignorance of the academic formatting rules? Besides, in your post-college years, you may have to publish your scientific studies and articles in journals, which simply refuse to print incorrectly formatted manuscripts. So, now you have a good chance to learn things which can help you boost your career opportunities. <br>But why would anyone need an APA format citation maker? If you wonder about this, then it is likely that you have not even opened the APA guide. If you take a look at the publication manual, you will find out that you should be aware of different ways of citing depending on the source of information and many other factors. It takes some time and effort, while an APA reference generator can save you both, having the work done for you. In order to use our APA citation generator, you just need to enter some basic data about your source and choose the source type. After that, the system will provide you with a correctly formatted reference, which you can copy and paste into your work. Fast and simple, yet very effective. That is really helpful and time-saving, especially because you get references based on the latest edition of the APA publication manual for free. In addition to this great tool, we provide a complete APA style guide which will help you understand its requirements faster and easier. So, let's find out what it means to write in APA format.</p>
